# Phasmophobia randomizer
The Phasmophobia Randomizer allows you to generate games between 1 and 4 players, with a random map to choose according to the places you own, and a list of objects defined by the number of players.

## How to play
* In normal mode:
  * Enter the names of all the players and generate the game. Each player will receive the **Number of randomly chosen objects** + **A random light source**.
  * You automatically have the right to 1 photo camera for the whole team, in order to validate the objective "Picture of entity". The 2 other photo cameras can be obtained in the wheel.

* In Safari mode:
  * [1-3 player(s)] Enter the names of all the players and generate the game. Each player will receive the **a random light source** + **a photo camera**.
  * [4 players] Enter the names of all the players and generate the game. One of the players will receive a random light source, while the others will all have a photo camera. On this mode, the light source player is named "The beacon", its role is to provide light for others.
  * You must use the Photo Cameras to retrieve items from the Item Wheel by taking pictures of Interractions, the Bone, the Ouija Board, Corpses, Fingerprints, the Dirty Water and the Ghost. THE PLAYER WITH A VALID PHOTO IN THE LOG WINS AN ITEM. Two players are not allowed to take the same picture.

## Objectives
You have to find the entity, take a picture of it. This is the key element to have the right to leave the map.

You have to find the entity type. It is not necessary to have the good one, but you must at least give a type of entity.

**A good part of it comes down to validating the 2 objectives above. A valid game is at least to have the photo of the ghost validated in the journal [J] with written "Ghost".**

## Items per players
In normal mode:
- 1 player = 5 items
- 2 players = 3 items/players
- 3 players = 2 items/players
- 4 players = 1 item/players

In Safari mode:
- 1 player = 5 items
- 2 players = 3 items/players
- 3 players = 2 items/players

## Rules
- You may not take more items than those given by the wheel. If you have more items to take than you have inventory space, it is up to you to manage your inventory and change items as needed.
- You are not allowed to pick up, touch or move other players' objects. Only the global photo camera in normal mode is for everyone.
- In multiplayer, you will be equipped with a front camera.
- You manage the pill boxes as you see fit. One idea you may have is to complete the secondary objects on the table (in the truck) and allow 1 team member (you choose each time) to take a pill / validated objectives.
